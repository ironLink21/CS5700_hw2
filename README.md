# Notes
This is my first time ever doing anything in Visual Studios & C#.  I spend most of my time learning
the mechanics of VS and C#.  I received a lot of help and understanding from Everett. He helped me with
a lot of my code.  I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish even though I didn't get all the 
patterns implemented.  I learned a lot in this project. 

# Dependencies
Windows Forms
I created the project in Visual Studios
